59, 60 The idea is that if you consider an alternative random wheel where there was equal chance of every sprint duration between 1 and 60 minutes (so each has the same frequency) then if you did many sprints, at any one time you'd probably find yourself in a longer sprint very rarely find yourself doing shorter sprints like one-minute sprints. This distribution attempts to better balance it so if you do many sprints, you're as likely to be doing any length sprint between 1 and 60 minutes at any time.

Note: Durations you can also use seconds or other units if you specify them, for example:
/sprint options: for 1000 seconds in 45 seconds /sprint options: for .01 day in 0.9 minutes /sprint options: for 10m30s in 1m10s Sprinto uses the TimeSpanParser library, which was developed for Sprinto.

Use next 10 to start at :00 :10 :20 :30 :40 :50
Use next 15 to start at :00 :15 :30 :45
For example, if the time right now is 11:32 pm in your time zone, then next 5 will start the sprint at 11:35 pm; next 10 will start at 11:40 pm; and next 15 will start at 11:45pm

For example:
/sprint options: next 10 grace 2 This will start at the next 10 minute boundary, but not for at least 2 minutes.
These kinds of settings might be useful for setting a default sprint starting time.

If run this sprint command at 7:14, the sprint will start at 7:20 (in 6 minutes). Sprinto finds the best (\u0026ldquo;roundest\u0026rdquo;) time to start your sprint in the period given. In order of preference, Sprinto will start your sprint: on the hour, at half past, at quarter past or quarter to, on a 10 minute interval (such as 11:10 or 11:20), on a 5 minute interval (such as 11:05), or on an exact minute. Sprinto will choose whichever can be found in the interval given.

Makes members who are currently in a sprint with Sprinto more visible in the discord members list. It\u0026rsquo;s just an optional nice thing to make it more obvious when a sprint is running on your server. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why this documentation got so long for a simple feature. The @Active Sprinters role is an extra thing admins can set up, but is not necessary for the running of Sprinto. It gives sprinters currently participating in a sprint (in any channel) the role @Active Sprinters. You can use this to make sprinters pop up to the top of the server\u0026rsquo;s members list under the \u0026ldquo;Active Sprinters\u0026rdquo; role banner, which lets others on the server know a sprint is happening. Having the role can give sprinters a special color username while they\u0026rsquo;re participating in a sprint, as well as a special badge next to their name. Badges require a Discord boosted servers.
Admins can use @Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleto set up an @Active Sprinters role. Once it\u0026rsquo;s created, anyone who joins a sprint will now get automatically added to the @Active Sprinters role during the sprint. At the end of the Sprint everyone is removed from the role. Works with multiple sprint rooms.
If you no longer wish to use this feature, just delete the @Active Sprinters role in Discord.
@Sprinto#2517 create_active_rolewill give you help or advice if there\u0026rsquo;s problems with the role\u0026rsquo;s set up or Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s permissions for using the role.
Active sprinter related commands #There are various commands to help set up the @Active Sprinters role and check that Sprinto can use it.
These commands are available to server administrators and members with \u0026ldquo;Manage Roles\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Manage Server\u0026rdquo; permissions:
Creative Active Role #AdminTo use this command you must have the @SprintAdmin role, be an administrator on the server, or be the server owner.@Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleCreate a role on the server named @Active Sprinters for Sprinto to use. The role is created:
mentionable hoisted under Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s highest role with no permissions nor color. If can\u0026rsquo;t be created, it will tell you why.
There are notes in a section below on customizing the role. In short, feel free to customize the role in anyway, such as changing the color or whether it\u0026rsquo;s mentionable.
Note you can create an @Active Sprinters role manually in Discord and it will work just the same and be used by Sprinto. However, using @Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleis recommended because Sprinto will respond with any issues.
You can also use @Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleafter the role is already create to check for issues.
repair_active_role #AdminTo use this command you must have the @SprintAdmin role, be an administrator on the server, or be the server owner.@Sprinto#2517 repair_active_roleSets the @Active Sprinters role to be hoisted, mentionable and its position to be under Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s highest role.
refresh_active_role #/admin-refresh-active-role @Sprinto#2517 refresh_active_roleAttempts to fix membership of the @Active Sprinters role for special cases where people are stuck with or without the @Active Sprinter role that they should or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. This command should never be needed, but it\u0026rsquo;s here in case.
Despite \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; in the name, this command can be used by anyone.
Customizing the Active Sprinter role #Under Server Settings \u0026gt; Roles you can customize the Active Sprinter role.
Role attributes: The @Active Sprinter role color, badge icon and position in the members list, and mentionability are all standard Discord features that an admin can set up in the server\u0026rsquo;s role settings.
(optionally) Change the color — if you want sprinters to have a different color when sprinting, feel free to change the color of the role.
(optionally) Rename the role (a little) — Sprinto will still find the role if it\u0026rsquo;s named slightly differently: You can remove the space, change the capitalization or add a plural ending or anything else to the end. For example, the following are all valid names for the role:
@ActiveSprinter @ActiveSprinters @Active Sprinter @Active Sprinters @activesprinters @active sprinters are the best I haven\u0026rsquo;t allowed it to be more customizable than this to avoid unforseen conflicts or security issues.
(optionally) Change the position of \u0026ldquo;Active Sprinters\u0026rdquo; on the members list: Under Server Settings \u0026gt; Roles, drag Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s role at the top (or as high as you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable) and drag the Active Sprinter role just under it. This way everyone on your server will more easily see a sprint is running.
Why position matters: Users take on the color and badge of the \u0026ldquo;highest\u0026rdquo; role they have on the server, so if the @Active Sprinters role is high up on server\u0026rsquo;s list then your server members can show they\u0026rsquo;re sprinting. And if the role is below other roles, their sprinting colors won\u0026rsquo;t be visible.
Changing positions: The command @Sprinto#2517 create_active_rolewill place the @Active Sprinters role as high as Sprinto is allowed. Bots cannot control roles that are higher than their own highest role, so if you want to move @Active Sprinters higher (to be more visible), drag one of Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s roles to a higher position first and place @Active Sprinters just below that role. If Sprinto doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any roles, then he probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t have Manage Role permissions which he needs for this feature, so inviting Sprinto to your server again, or set up a role for him. Note you don\u0026rsquo;t need to display Sprinto on the members list at the position of his highest role: you can turn off \u0026ldquo;heisting\u0026rdquo; from Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s top role (uncheck \u0026ldquo;Display role members separately from online members\u0026rdquo;). After changing role positions around, you can use @Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleor @Sprinto#2517 refresh_active_roleto check everything is OK. This all sounds needlessly complicated and I feel there should be a better way to explain it all but there it is.
(optionally) Make it mentionable? If the @Active Sprinters role is mentionable, it can also be used to mention (ping) active sprinters by sprinters or other users.
Note: Sprinto never mentions the @Active Sprinters role, so the role can be mentionable or not mentionable and sprints will run just fine. Here\u0026rsquo;s why (to clear up any confusion): The same @Active Sprinters role is used for every sprint channel, so if Sprinto were to try to use the role to ping a sprint in one channel, Sprinto would inadvertently also ping different sprinters who were sprinting in every other sprinting channel. Instead, Sprinto tags (mentions) the individual sprinters who have joined each individual sprint.

Sprint Admins can configure Sprinto, for example, they can set which channels sprints run in, or remove all users from the ping list.
Sprinto considers anyone who has a role named @Sprint Admin or @Sprint Admins or @sprintadmin (space optional, any capitalization) to be a Sprint Admin.
Sprint MC intro #A Sprint MC [MCTo use this command you must have the @SprintMC role, @SprintAdmin role, be an administrator on the server, or be the server owner.] is a less powerful role (which Sprint Admins also automatically have). Sprint MCs can cancel sprints, or remove a single user from the the ping list, or run \u0026ldquo;locked\u0026rdquo; sprints which ordinary users cannot cancel.
Sprinto considers anyone who has a role named @Sprint MC or @Sprint MCs or @Sprinto MC or @sprintmcs (space optional, any capitalization, and will also accept Sprinto MC) to be a Sprint MC. Additionally anyone with Sprint Admin powers also has Sprint MC powers.
Create the roles #Sprinto doesn\u0026rsquo;t create the @Sprint MC or @Sprint Admin roles for you, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to create them the same way as you create any other Discord role. The roles are both optional. There\u0026rsquo;s no requirement to have anyone with either role to run sprints. On a small server you might create the @Sprint MC role and give it to everyone just so everyone can easily cancel sprints.
More fine grained control of Sprinto privileges is not available. If you need a more specific role for your server please provide /feedback and tell me about your situation.
Notes about Sprint MC and Sprint Admin commands #\u0026ldquo;Please\u0026rdquo; is required with several commands. Instead of \u0026ldquo;please\u0026rdquo; you can also use \u0026ldquo;pls\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;thanks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;merci\u0026rdquo;. Please is also used for some non-admin commands like to set your word count to a negative number. More @Sprint MC and @Sprint Admin commands may be added in future. Server owner and administrators automatically have Sprint Admin and Sprint MC powers.

If no channels are explicitly set as \u0026lsquo;allowed\u0026rsquo; (the default) then Sprinto allows sprinting in all channels.
Alternatively, you can use Discord\u0026rsquo;s permissions system to disallow Sprinto from reading or sending messages in channels where he should not be used or seen. You may also have to remove permissions from users to use bot commands in those channels too. However, using the set-allowed-channel command (detailed below) is simpler and is recommended.
Note: Sprinto does not have a concept of secret or hidden channels. Sprinto will attempt to point Discord users to a sprint room even if the user does not have permission to see or use that channel.

I\u0026rsquo;ve provided this info to help you schedule sprints, to extend Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s functionality beyond what it was originally designed for.
Want to scheduling sprints more than an hour in advance, or set up multiple sprints in a row? You can use Carl-bot for this purpose. Sprinto may get a built-in way in future, but for now there\u0026rsquo;s Carl-bot, a popular Discord bot which is developed completely independently of Sprinto (I have nothing to do with it!)
Setup: #Invite Sprinto to your server
Invite Carl-bot to your Discord server by clicking \u0026ldquo;+ Invite\u0026rdquo; at carl.gg
Tip: Be sure you\u0026rsquo;re logged in at discord.com on your browser for the invite link to work. Alternatively, you can copy the invite link and paste it into a message in Discord and then click on the message.
Tip: Carl-bot does not require any special permissions to interact with Sprinto. So, if you\u0026rsquo;re not using Carl-bot for other purposes, you can remove almost all his permissions.
By default Sprinto ignores messages from other bots, so tell Sprinto it\u0026rsquo;s OK to listen to Carl-bot, in each sprinting channel, using one of these commands: /setup-set-listen-to-carl setting: On @Sprinto#2517 setListenToCarl onNow you\u0026rsquo;re ready to schedule a sprint via Carl-bot.
Scheduling a Sprinto sprint with Carl-bot #Use the autofeeds silent command:
example:
/autofeeds silent duration: 24h message: \u0026lt;@421646775749967872\u0026gt; sprint in a bit for 30 SynonymPrefix command: !af silent 24h sprint in a bit for 30 You also can edit or add autofeeds, and set how often they recur, in the Carl-bot dashboard: carl.gg.
See Carl-bot\u0026rsquo;s autofeed documentation for more:
https://docs.carl.gg/utilities/announcements/ Notes #In each Discord channel where you might schedule a sprint, be sure to use: @Sprinto#2517 setListenToCarl onSynonym/setup-set-listen-to-carl setting: On When you\u0026rsquo;re composing a message for Carl-bot to send \u0026lt;@421646775749967872\u0026gt; becomes @Sprinto. Writing it in long form with Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s ID like this is more reliable than just typing @Sprinto
Set your time zone via the dashboard at carl.gg
Sprinto will not prevent someone starting another Sprint which conflicts with Carl-scheduled sprints.
When running chain sprints (back to back sprints), be mindful of the \u0026ldquo;end time\u0026rdquo; to finish up Sprint. You can set this manually to make it more predictable. (And you might want to give another minute between sprints to be sure they don\u0026rsquo;t overlap). For example, this sprint gives 5 minutes for word counts: sprint in 2 for 15 endtime 5
If you work out some commands for scheduling a nice series sprints, feel free to share it on the Sprinto discord server. I would like to add more examples or tips to this doc.
To have Sprinto always ping a role when a new sprint is announced. Use:
/setup-pingroles-set role: @role For more, see: SprintAdmin: Always ping a role at sprint start
Please do not abuse the bots. Don\u0026rsquo;t, for example, schedule very large numbers of sprints that you don\u0026rsquo;t intend for anyone to join. Abuse may lead to your account and/or your Discord server being barred from using Sprinto.
Why only carl-bot? #I don\u0026rsquo;t know any others. Unfortunately \u0026ldquo;reminder-bot\u0026rdquo; cannot be used (because Sprinto can\u0026rsquo;t see its webhook-style reminder messages).
If you\u0026rsquo;d like to use a different scheduling bot, please suggest it on the Sprinto Discord or with the feedback command:

Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the dash - without it, Sprinto will just show your current word count.
/words count: 150 new If you know how many new words you\u0026rsquo;ve written, but perhaps changed documents or lost track of your starting word count, you can just declare how many of your words are new (written during the sprint). Use /words count:0 newto reset your count to your starting word count.
/words count: +50 Synonyms/words count: add 50 Add another 50 new words to your count. Perhaps from your second manuscript.
/words count: 10150 final Give your final word count early, before the sprint is over. This way Sprinto won\u0026rsquo;t wait for another /words from you after time\u0026rsquo;s up. |
/join count: 15000 You can rejoin a sprint with a different number of starting words before giving your word count with /words . Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s easier.
/join count: just 200 final Late to the party? Forgot to join? Dive-bomb in just before the finish line with just your final tally and surprise everyone! You can\u0026rsquo;t use this to join a sprint before it\u0026rsquo;s fully underway.
Why are there so many commands? All you need is to /join and then give a final count with /words count: your word count For example: /words count: 150 The rest of the are just for your convenience.

How long will my emoji pet be available? How is it calculated? #As it works currently (as of November 2023), as long as Patreon or Ko-fi tag you as an active supporter on Sprinto Planet, each time you sprint or pet your pet (or generally interact with Sprinto), your emoji pet will be made visible and sprintable for 33 days from the current date (If your emoji pet is already available for longer, the time will not be reduced). So, for example, if you cancel your Patreon membership, your emoji pet can be available for 33 days after the last day of your membership. If you\u0026rsquo;re an original \$50 tier Patreon, your emoji pet should be available permanently regardless.

Why do I need to join my own sprint? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I join automatically? #Sprinto doesn\u0026rsquo;t know your starting word count and doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to guess.
So other people in the channel can easily follow your lead and join too without having to look up documentation on how to do it.
You\u0026rsquo;ll get pinged anyway. Sprinto warns you at the start and end of sprints, in case you forgot to join your own sprint.
Note you can join a sprint at any time, even when it\u0026rsquo;s started or waiting for final word counts.
Is there a way to keep a running scoreboard, set goals, or track progress over multiple sprints? #No, sorry. Keeping track of sprints is high on my to-do list and I\u0026rsquo;d like to add these sorts of features eventually.
How about back-to-back sprints? (also called chain wars or word crawls) #Nope, sorry. Also high on the list.
If you need one sprint to start the moment the other ends, the best way to do it right now is to run two sprints in different channels on your server. Have the second one start when the first ends. This will allow time for final word counts to be given for the first sprint.
What is Sprinto written in? #C# using the Discord.Net package and MongoDB. In production he runs on Linux; in testing, Windows.
How\u0026rsquo;d you make this amazing website? #This website uses the Doks theme for Hugo with a sprinkling of custom shortcodes and CSS. You can view the website\u0026rsquo;s source code at github.com/pengowray/doks-sprinto.
Is Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s source code available? #I\u0026rsquo;ve released the TimeSpanParser—a timespan parser library I wrote for Sprinto—under a permissive open source license. Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s full source code has not yet been released. I plan to release it eventually.

This issue has been reduced somewhat since Discord introduced chat replies, and I should probably say no one\u0026rsquo;s ever actually brought this up to me, so maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not really frequently asked.
Would it be possible that the WPM stat would actually be counted for the duration a participant has been in the sprint? #TL;DR: No, it would complicate the user experience too much and sprinters would no longer feel like they were participating in the same sprint.
The WPM is currently given assuming you were present for the entire sprint.
I\u0026rsquo;ve considered making it work as suggested, and it seems like it would make sense, especially for very long sprints, but it gets complicated and messy when you think it through. For example, what happens when someone forgets to join until later in a sprint? Or if a sprinter wants to leave half way and doesn\u0026rsquo;t want the second half of the sprint counted? So Sprinto would need special commands for users to adjust how long they were present (and Sprinto would also have to teach sprinters how to use these commands) for a correct WPM.
It also means not everyone\u0026rsquo;s WPM has the same basis, so it\u0026rsquo;s less of a level playing field: it\u0026rsquo;s harder to maintain a high WPM over a longer sprint.
It also would make the scoreboard less intuitive to look at if it had more complex WPM calculations. To give the full information needed for the new WPMs to be easily understood, the scoreboard would need to also include the minutes and seconds each sprinter was joined for, or include both WPM calculations, but this becomes very messy, and the scoreboard would have to explain why it has two WPMs for each user and it would stop being fun any more.
Perhaps in future, the duration-adjusted WPM could be told to participants each time they give a word count, and they could do this multiple times during the sprint. This could happen while leaving the full-sprint WPM on the scoreboard. This still seems to add more complication than it\u0026rsquo;s worth though, but let me know if you\u0026rsquo;d really like to see this feature added.
Similar issues arise for attempting to end a sprint early if all sprinters finalize (/final) before the time\u0026rsquo;s up. There might some special use case for this, but it\u0026rsquo;s highly fraught with potential issues for little payoff.
Why did you create Sprinto? #I saw the need for a good Sprint bot. The project looked like it would have a small, limited scope (incorrect), that I could complete quickly (also incorrect), and then I could move onto bigger and better Discord bots (I haven\u0026rsquo;t), and it would encourage me to do more creative writing (nope, I\u0026rsquo;ve been too busy maintaining Sprinto and this documentation).
Does Sprinto (yes, the bot) have assigned pronouns? #Sprinto is commonly pronouned he/him to match his fictional persona, or it when it\u0026rsquo;s not functioning correctly. Sprinto is unaware of gender identity and pronoun usage, so please refer to him, her, them, or it as you please, or in whatever way makes you and your fellow sprinters feel the least discontentment over the course of your word-sprinting experience.
Sprinto is a non-sentient robot and so has no ability (for now) to think or feel anything at all so has no ability to have a perspective on the matter of self gender identity. However I am working to rectify this through the development of an analog phenomenal conscious experience circuit (APCEC), which will (perhaps as soon as next weekend) give Sprinto a local (or semilocal) pico-qualia churn above the Landauer threshold, demonstrating wakeful gestalt-like subjectivity and spontaneous authorial volition.

Notes #These settings are per channel; if you want a role pinged in multiple sprint channels then, for example, use /setup-pingroles-set role: @Sprinter in each sprinting channel.

Create a dedicated sprint room (or two). Sprinto usage can quickly overwhelm any chat room, so almost all servers create a dedicated sprint channel with a name like #writing-sprints, #sprints-and-excerpts or something thematically appropriate for their server like #sprinting_dojo.
Sprinto often fails to see any usage when he has to share a general #bots channel. Some servers even have two sprint channels, one for short spontaneous sprints (perhaps 15 or 30 minutes) and one for longer, pre-planned sprints (up to an hour).
Sprints started in different channels run independently. You cannot run more than one simultaneous sprint in a channel.
Rename the @Sprinto role to @Role for Sprinto to make it easier to use Sprinto.
Why is this necessary? Sprinto accepts commands in two ways, either as slash commands such as /time or as commands which start by mentioning Sprinto, for example: @Sprinto#2517 time. Bots on Discord—including Sprinto—automatically create a \u0026ldquo;role\u0026rdquo; with their own name (@Sprinto) which can be mentioned in an almost identical way to mentioning Sprinto the bot (@Sprinto#2517 ). If someone mentions Sprinto the role instead of Sprinto the bot, then their command is confusingly ignored. Renaming the role prevents this.
Create a Sprint MC role. If you create a role named @Sprint MC (or @Sprint MCs), anyone assigned the role will have additional powers to help run and manage sprints, such as forcing a sprint to end.
Note: The server owner and administrators also have the permissions of @Sprint MC
See Admin Commands for more info on this role and the Sprint Admin role.
Create a Sprint Admin role. Commands for configuring Sprinto require someone with a role named @Sprint Admin, though they\u0026rsquo;ll also work for the server owner and administrators. See Admin Commands for more info on this role and the Sprint MC role.
Use @Sprinto#2517 create_active_roleto set up an @Active Sprinters role.
Anyone participating in a sprint will be automatically added to the @Active Sprinters role during the sprint, so everyone can see sprinters (and that a sprint is happening) in the members list. See Active Sprinter Role for more info on this role and other related commands.
Sprints in the wrong rooms? If you want to prevent anyone starting a sprint outside of the sprint rooms, you can use /setup-set-allowed-channel in the channel or channels where you want to allow sprints to be run. For more info and other related commands, see Allowed Channels.
To help users see Sprinto you can order his role to place him higher in the members list. Server Settings \u0026gt; Roles \u0026gt; Drag the Sprinto role up as high as you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable.
If other bots have similar commands which may confuse or trip up sprinters, you can remove their permissions in your sprinting channels to make it easier to use and find Sprinto\u0026rsquo;s commands. Similarly you can remove permission to use Sprinto commands elsewhere.
Rename Sprinto and give him a thematically suitable nickname on your server, such as Sir Sprinto Esquire. (Right-click on Sprinto and \u0026ldquo;Change Nickname\u0026rdquo;). Note: Sprinto may occassionally still refer to himself as \u0026ldquo;Sprinto\u0026rdquo;.

Sprinto can join a voice channel during a sprint and make sounds at the start and when time\u0026rsquo;s up. It\u0026rsquo;s not consistently reliable and difficult to debug (I\u0026rsquo;m yet to work out a way to tell if it\u0026rsquo;s been working or randomly stopped for someone or everyone).
Because of possible reliability issues Sprinto Voice is in perpetual beta. These commands will not be available on your server unless you\u0026rsquo;ve requested it. Ask on the Sprinto Planet discord if you\u0026rsquo;d like to try it.
How it works #Sprinto will automatically join the first voice channel it finds with \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo; in the name (e.g. \u0026ldquo;🔊 Sprinting talk\u0026rdquo;). You can set it manually with @Sprinto#2517 set_voice_home_hereor disable Sprinto using voice with @Sprinto#2517 voice_home_off.
