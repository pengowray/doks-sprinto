## Emoji Pet

![Emoji Pet demo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/622903029330346006/622989709626441730/unknown.png)

Your very own emoji pet is available as a reward to [Sprinto Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/pengowray) and recurring Ko-fi supporters.

Your emoji pet will keep you company on sprints and stop you from ever coming last 🙂

All current Sprinto Patreons ($2 tier and above) will receive an emoji pet. You need to link your Patreon or Ko-fi account to your Discord account and join Sprinto Planet (the support Discord). If you have any issues, please let me know (Pengo Wray) on Sprinto Planet.

**Emoji Pet Lore:** Originally emoji pets were a meme for the $50 Patreon tier, because I didn't think anyone would ever choose that tier, so I didn't expect to have to code them up. Then someone did, so I did. But now Emoji Pets are now available to all Patreons. In future, hopefully I'll have some custom comissioned pixel art pets available.

## Emoji Pet Support

If you're a Patreon with an emoji pet reward and aren't seeing your emoji pet, please make sure you've joined Sprinto Planet (the support Discord) and you've linked your Discord and Patreon accounts, or Ko-fi and Discord. Your emoji pet will automatically appear. Let me know if you have any issues.

## How long will my emoji pet be available? How is it calculated?

As it works currently (as of November 2023), as long as Patreon or Ko-fi tag you as an active supporter on Sprinto Planet, each time you sprint or pet your pet (or generally interact with Sprinto), your emoji pet will be made visible and sprintable for 33 days from the current date (If your emoji pet is already available for longer, the time will not be reduced). So, for example, if you cancel your Patreon membership, your emoji pet can be available for 33 days after the last day of your membership. If you're an original $50 tier Patreon, your emoji pet should be available permanently regardless.
