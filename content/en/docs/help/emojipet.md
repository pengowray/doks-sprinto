## Emoji Pet

![Emoji Pet demo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/622903029330346006/622989709626441730/unknown.png)

Your very own emoji pet is available as a reward to [Sprinto Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/pengowray) and Ko-fi supporters. 

Your emoji pet will keep you company on sprints and stop you from ever coming last ðŸ™‚

As of November 2023, all Sprinto Patreons ($2 tier and above) and all Ko-fi supporters will receive an emoji pet for November. If you're a Patreon or Ko-fi supporter and don't have an emoji pet, please let me know.

**Emoji Pet Lore:** (As at November 2023) Originally emoji pets were a meme for the $50 Patreon tier, because I didn't think anyone would ever choose that tier, so I didn't expect to have to code them up. Then someone did, so I did. Emoji pets are now available during November (Nanowrimo) to all Patreons, and I'm still working out how they'll work beyond Novemeber but I don't have plans to remove them. I've also started work on some bigger rewards for higher tiers (sorry they weren't ready for nano this year), but for now, enjoy your emoji pet!

## Emoji Pet Support

If you're a Patreon with an emoji pet reward and aren't seeing your emoji pet, please make sure you've joined Sprinto Planet (the support Discord) and you've linked your Discord and Patreon accounts, or Ko-fi and Discord. Your emoji pet will automatically appear. Let me know if you have any issues.

## How long will my emoji pet be available? How is it calculated?

As it works currently (as of November 2023), as long as Patreon or Ko-fi tag you as an active supporter on Sprinto Planet, each time you sprint or pet your pet (or generally interact with Sprinto), your emoji pet will be made visible and sprintable for 33 days from the current date (If your emoji pet is already available for longer, the time will not be reduced). So, for example, if you cancel your Patreon membership, your emoji pet can be available for 33 days after the last day of your membership. If you're an original $50 tier Patreon, your emoji pet should be available permanently regardless.
