## Setting up Sprinto (Server owners/managers)

**Steps:**
1. If you can see Sprinto already:

Or via the web:

1. **[Invite Sprinto](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=421646775749967872&scope=bot&permissions=2419424576)** â€” Bring Sprinto to your Discord server.

2. That's it. You're ready to Sprint! Type `/sprint` in a channel to start a sprint.

## Troubleshooting and notes 

* All requested permissions are optional: If you're worried about a robot uprising, you can uncheck them all and still run sprints just fine. But they are recommended for extra features (current and future).

* Make sure you're logged in at [discord.com](https://discord.com/) and try to invite Sprinto again.

* If you don't have permission, pass on the invite link to the server owner or someone who has permission to add bots: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=421646775749967872&scope=bot&permissions=2419424576 or give the link to this page. <!-- or use Sprinto's `/setup invite` command... which sends you here now. -->
